# album-covers-spotipy
This project will allow you to download every album cover from any artist on Spotify as a JPEG file.

Use the python file script uploaded to this project. All you have to do is input the artist URI in the code and run. One issue currently, is where ever you run the python file is where the images will be saved -- regardless of where you put the directory output as.

NOTE: This requires the Spotipy library, so please install and go through any authorization processs necessary.
