# album-covers-spotipy
This project will allow you to download every album cover, all at once, from any artist on Spotify saved as a JPEG file.

Using the python file script uploaded to this project, input the artist URI in the code and run. One issue currently, is where ever you run the python file is where the images will be saved -- regardless of what you put the directory output as.

NOTE: This requires the Spotipy library, so please install and go through any authorization processs necessary. It also requires wget library installation.
